- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JMSPere, I am 25 years old and I am into music, videogames and software development either in backend or games.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software developing projects, specially those regarding games or backend development.
- ðŸŒ± I've worked with C/C++ (even though most of it was pure C), Java and more recently with C# and .NET (both with Framework and Core) as well as SQL and Redis.
